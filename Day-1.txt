GAI -> AI, ML, DL, NN, LLM, GAI
Agents -> Tools, KB, LLM 
Agentic AI -> Orcastrate the Agents -> Foundry -> langchain -> AWS Bedrock -> OpenAI

1. Limitations -> Mitigated  

Order -> Data -> Feature to describe your order -> manually label 
    1. pickup 
    2. delivery 
    3. total 
    4. tip 

ML -> 
    supervised

    unsupervise -> data -> no manual activity for labeling-> algorithm -> u segregate the data as per your understading -> look for color, look for size 

    semi suprevised -> algorithm -> manually -> unsupervise 
        1. manually labeled
        2. look for color, look for size

    self supervised -> no human intervention 
        1. labeling is done by algorithm -> 
        2. unsupervised learning look for color, look for size 

    RL 

    RLHF




    1. discriminative activities -> desison mainking -> supervised data set -> yes or no -> label the data image are labeled and then use it in ur usecase 
    2. generative activities -> create a image or vijay with a background of raining weather 


Speech recognition: 
    1. frequency -> sign wave -> sampling theorm -> samples [phoneoms] -> network [state diagram] -> word 
        A -> male, female, accent 


CLI -> 
    shell -> predefined commands -> rm  -> actions 

NLP -> 
    model -> commands [delete a file, remove a file, put the file in a bin] -> rm -> actions 


Scale -> 
    as the system requires for processing a task allocate the resources.

    application deployment -> Bench Marking of application -> on this infra this is the behaviour 

    1. web service -> 16gb ram, 1 tb sdd, 1000mbs network, 16 core cpu -> 1000 concurent request 

    1. VS ->  16gb ram, 1 tb sdd, 1000mbs network, 16 core cpu -> 200
    2. HS -> lb -> k8s -> containers -> predefined config -> os, resources -> application
        16gb ram, 1 tb sdd, 1000mbs network, 16 core cpu
        16gb ram, 1 tb sdd, 1000mbs network, 16 core cpu
        16gb ram, 1 tb sdd, 1000mbs network, 16 core cpu
        16gb ram, 1 tb sdd, 1000mbs network, 16 core cpu
        16gb ram, 1 tb sdd, 1000mbs network, 16 core cpu 


    1. threads -> tasks 
    2. functional pragraming -> lambda functions -> [never share a context between functions ] [parameters() -> renturn ]


create a video or vijay with a background of raining weather
upload a image  I/p
    |
-> embedings [vector array -> numbers]
    |
[trained -> text, image, video] Model [process the prompt and prepare the output] [vector array] 
    |
Softmax -> [ pptx] -> xml kind  
    |
video [mp4]

                                    []
Prompt -> application [chatgpt] ->  [size]     ->        LLM  [server] stateless 


Clacification algo
Algorithm -> program -> process -> single system
                        Process -> Distributed network of systems -> 8 months + 1000 of gpu's 
                                -> functional prgraming -> parallel process  -> processed data 
                                -> db -> data will be stored in db -> pattern 
                        Attention what is needed
